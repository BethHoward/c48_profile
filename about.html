		<h1>About Beth</h1>		
			<p><img src='images/2015-01-31_Beth-Alley.jpg' alt='cat photo' height=250></p>
			<p>This is a picture of me with one of my cats! His name is Alley. He's really old.</p>
		
		<h2>Bio</h2>
			<p>I was born in CT and have lived in FL, WA, IL and now WA again. I'm super happy to have moved back to Seattle a couple years ago; it's my favorite city to live in.</p>
			
			<p>For the last six years, I've worked for an international non-profit called <a href="http://www.worldbicyclerelief.org">World Bicycle Relief</a>. I'm currently responsible for our donor database and fundraising analytics. I work remotely; the rest of my immediate team is based in Chicago. I collaborate with colleagues in countries all over the world: the UK, Austria, Germany, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya.

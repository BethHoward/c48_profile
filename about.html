			<h2>Bio</h2>
				<p>I was born in CT and have lived in FL, WA, IL and now WA again. I'm super happy to have moved back to Seattle a couple years ago; it's my favorite city to live in. I love being close to both the mountains and the coast.</p>
			
				<p>For the last six years, I've worked for an international non-profit called <a href="http://www.worldbicyclerelief.org">World Bicycle Relief</a>. I'm currently responsible for our donor database and fundraising analytics. I work remotely; the rest of my immediate team is based in Chicago. I collaborate with colleagues in countries all over the world: the UK, Austria, Germany, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya.

			<h2>Education</h2>	
				<p>I have a Masters degree in Linguistics from Northeastern Illinois University (2008).</p>
